LAB Servo Driver Library 
========================

This python library was created to control servo motors using the 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Drivers from Adafruit. This is an early version of the library that has not been thoroughly tested. More documentation to come soon. In the meantime you can check out the code and example if you want to try out the library.
